# Vehicle-Tracking-and-Navigation-System
Objective: Create a GPS-based tracking and navigation system for vehicles, where users can track their location and optimize their routes.


Topics Covered:

• Basic Syntax & Operators: Track and display vehicle coordinates (latitude, longitude).
• Control Flow: Use conditions to check if the vehicle is off-route or near a destination.
• OOP Concepts:
o Classes & Objects: Define a Vehicle class with properties like current location, speed, and destination.
o Encapsulation: Encapsulate vehicle data within objects and provide getter/setter methods.
• Inheritance & Polymorphism: Create subclasses for specific vehicle types (e.g., ElectricCar, SUV) and override route calculation methods based on vehicle type.
• Templates: Implement a template class for managing navigation routes.
• Exception Handling: Handle GPS signal loss or invalid data.
• STL & Algorithms: Use STL containers for storing waypoints and implement algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* for route optimization.
• Concurrency: Track multiple vehicles at the same time with separate threads.
• Design Patterns:
o Strategy Pattern: Implement different route calculation strategies (e.g., fastest, least fuel-consuming).
o Observer Pattern: Alert users of route changes or traffic conditions.
